The entire Hanthawaddy forces of the 1740s won against the Toungoo forces above Burma. The Siamese were concerned about the new uprising power in Burma, because strong Burma marked historic attacks on Siam. Concerned, the Siamese court readily protected the Burmese governor of Martaban and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745 they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava to assess the political situation there, and they were received by Burmese King Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw the Ava field that was on its last legs. By 1751, Ava was approached by the restored Hanthawaddy forces. The Siamese were concerned about the birth of a strong dynasty in Pegu. Perhaps as a precaution, the Siamese decided to transfer their base to the upper coast in 1751. Although it is unclear whether the Siamese are ever going to cross the coast of the mainland to Ala-Burma, the Siamese were still ringing alarm bells in Pegu. With deep concern, the Hanthawaddy leadership pulled two thirds of its army back to Ala-Burma right after it had overthrown the last king of Toungoo in April 1752. This relocation of Hanthawaddy\u2019s troops proved to be a critical turning point in Burma\u2019s history when it gave the burgeoning Upper Burma resistance groups much needed breathing space. Under the command of Hanthawaddy, there were less than 10,000 men calming down the entire Upper Burma. Using the light Hanthawaddy force, one resistance group, the Konbaung dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove the Hanthawaddy troops out of Burma by May 1754. Konbaung\u2019s armies attacked Ala-Burma in 1755 and took Pegu in 1757 and ended the 17-year-old Mon Kingdom.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1185, "text": "1752"}], "question": "When did the Hanthawaddi withdraw most of their troops from Upper Burma?", "id": "381ef468-9cc8-4b70-98b2-eab5183952b3"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1711, "text": "17"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "17"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "17"}], "question": "How many years was the Mon kingdom", "id": "1e50dd00-e837-4ecc-8265-83365d286aa4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1711, "text": "17"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "17"}], "question": "How many years did the Mon kingdom last for?", "id": "f30a67b1-f4bc-4234-916f-fcfbd108fd06"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 336, "text": "the Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 205, "text": "The Siamese"}], "question": "Who sent a diplomatic mission to Ava in 1745?", "id": "9c705782-ac19-40ab-9a34-1e615ed4a96f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1711, "text": "17"}], "question": "How many years after Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma did they capture Pegu?", "id": "d4d36574-7e49-4ec8-86c1-726edab89951"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 336, "text": "the Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 340, "text": "Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 209, "text": "Siamese"}, {"answer_start": 340, "text": "Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 319, "text": "Siam"}, {"answer_start": 319, "text": "Siam"}, {"answer_start": 336, "text": "the Siamese court"}, {"answer_start": 336, "text": "the Siamese"}], "question": "Who sent diplomatic missions to Ava in 1745?", "id": "76171dd3-01f2-4667-8753-9bd8943c4f54"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 440, "text": "1745"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}, {"answer_start": 479, "text": "Ava"}], "question": "Where were the Siamese recieved by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi?", "id": "791cbdcc-7b3c-484d-96ec-a6bdf5cb8fb1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1185, "text": "1752"}, {"answer_start": 1185, "text": "1752"}, {"answer_start": 639, "text": "1751"}, {"answer_start": 1185, "text": "1752"}], "question": "When were Hanthawaddy troops redeployed to lower Burma?", "id": "66dac7cd-fdc3-47df-a80d-c9e9e538d657"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 843, "text": "the upper coast"}], "question": "What happened first, Siamese were in upper coast or Hanthawaddy withdrew army to Lower Burma?", "id": "ede489aa-50de-4470-b63e-959a28fd1228"}]}]}, {"title": "nfl_1378", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The bear won the Seahawks and won Detroit Lions in the 4th NFC North duel.

Both defenses played well in the first quarter, which ended with the Colts leading 3-0. Denver took the lead at the beginning of the second quarter on Jake Plummer's one-yard run. Indianapolis cut the lead on his next round, which ended with a 30-yard Adam Vinatier goal, but Broncos responded with a 15-yard goal pitch from QB Jake Plummer to WR Javon Walker just before half time to expand its lead to 14-6. In their first round, the halftime Indianapolis got one point away from the 12-yard goal feed from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne. On the next hand of the Colts, Wayne and Manning reunited the second touchdown, this 5-yard TD feed, which allowed them to take the lead from 20 to 14. The Broncos returned on Mike Bell's one-yard run, which gave them one point lead at the end of the third quarter. After Vinatier\u2019s goal in the field and Denver\u2019s touchdown, the Colts had a loss of 5 points compared to just over half of the fourth quarter.

The Colts were now on the rise of one point and decided to go for a two - point conversion, where they rose with field paint. The conversion was successful when Manning found Reggie Wayne again at the finish line. Jason Elam came to Denver and scored a 49-yard goal at 31. The final time of the game led to Adam Vinatier's field goal, while two seconds were left to raise Indianapolis by three.

It became one of the most stable currencies in Europe when it was introduced in relation to the Austrian-Hungary currency 1:1. The first republic became one of the ten most developed countries in the world. The economic consequences of the Munich Treaty and the post-Multi-M\u00fcnchen occupation were disastrous.

In line with Stalin's policy of interdependency development, all the economies of the socialist countries were closely linked to the Soviet economy. Czechoslovakia was the wealthiest country in the Eastern bloc, but it was still lagging behind the rest of the developed world. After the break-up of the Communist economic union in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among the former Communist countries of the East.

Jeff Joniak wrote that the aim of the Bears crime was to reach the target point. After Mitchell Trubisk started the attack, the Red Zone had only been attacked twice in three games when both trips ended in field goals. After reaching the 20-yard running game, Jordan Howard finished fifth in the league, second in the yards after contact and led the attack first down by 32. The defense of the saints, on the other hand, was placed in the 30th place in the rush yards, which are allowed per stump. Joniak also stressed that Trubis too is forced to tune the Superdome audience and lead the attack without making mistakes. As a defense, it encountered Drew Brees, who, according to Joniaki, had to be pressured quickly if the Bears were successful - while Brees was under attack, he was abducted three times and fired twice. Otherwise, Brees quickly managed to feed the ball to the six-yard wins with a fast-paced attack. In the last two games, the Bears had forced six and scored three goals, and Brees had recorded turnover in the last two games, but Saints was still the fifth best turnover difference. With the opening part of the saints, Will Lutz was preparing for a 32-yard field goal when Kyle Fuller was punished for jumping off the block. This set up an eight-yard run for Alvin Kamara, where New Orleans rose by seven points. After the next two departures, Connor Barth scored a 27-yard goal in the second quarter, although Mark Ingram Jr. scored a one-yard goal. Barth lost the 48-yard field goal very late in the first half when Bear came to halftime with an 11-point underpower. In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a 25-yard goal pitch at Zach Miller, who landed on his knees and dislocated at the same time. Touchdown was finally annulled when the referee Carl Cheffers decided that Miller had let the ball into the ground in pain. The bears had to settle for Barth's 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Lutz kicked a 45-yard field goal to increase the lead to 17-6. With 7:32 left in the game, Jonathan Bullard took Ingram and Christian Jones recovered. With Trubisk's 46-yard run, Tarik Cohen dived from one-yard line of the Saints to the end of the goal and scored the first in the 25-series (date for the Baltimore match). The bear did not succeed in scoring two points in conversion, but was only five points away. Chicago forced another tackle when Adrian Amos took the ball from Ingram and took the ball back when the lot was left at 2:12 p.m. Although the Bears turned the ball over, they had a second chance after Lutz\u2019s 49 - yard goal took them eight points away. However, Trubisk's passport for Tre McBride was stopped by Marshon Lattimore in order to seal the defeat. Miller was taken to the University Medical Center in New Orleans. In addition to the dislocation of the knee, Miller was found to have torn up the spring artery in his area, which is common in car accidents, and to increase the possibility of amputation. The vascular surgery was successfully completed the day after the game. The fall of Miller's prey was controversial. Cheffers defended the call saying that when Miller fell into territory, he'd have to get out of the country. He went down, he lost control of the ball temporarily. The ball hit the ground, so it's incomplete.\" The Deputy Director of the NFL acting Alberto Riveron also claimed that Miller had not finished the catch, but the predecessors Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino claimed otherwise. \"Sometimes the catch process ends, and it ends when he rolls over with control. It was decided to be a prey in the field. I did not see any definitive repeal, and quite frankly, if it had been found to be inadequate in the field, if it had been me in the command centre, I would have turned it into a catch,\" Blandino says.

The Siamese king had approved the nobles of Lao, who had used their power against the Lao people and against the tribes speaking Alak and Laven. Larger groups of tribes often raided weaker tribes that kidnapped people and sold them as slaves at the Champasak shopping center, while being preyed on by Khmer, Lao, and Siamese slave traders. From Champasak the slaves were transported to Phnom-Penh and Bangkok, which brought great victories to slaves and various intermediaries. In 1874 and 1884, King Chulalongkorn issued two decrees prohibiting the capture and sale of Khan\u2019s slaves while at the same time releasing all slaves born after 1868. Those abolition policies had a direct impact on slave trade communities. In 1883, France attempted to extend its surveillance in South-East Asia, claiming that the Huu Agreement extended to all the vassal states of Vietnam.

Some political leaders of the Polish rebel movement sent ambassadors to Japan to cooperate in the collection of sabotage and intelligence data in the Russian Empire and even to plan an uprising supported by the Japanese. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led to a short-term reform of the Russian army, which led to the first World War in Germany. However, the rebels were at home after seeds were sown in the war before the Russian Revolution in 1917. This was because Czar Nicholas II published the October manifesto, which contained only limited reforms, such as the Duma, and failed to address the social problems of Russia at the time.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 365, "text": "discontent"}], "question": "how fid the russians feel after the loss to the japanese?", "id": "9b2b5519-a8dc-43f1-a4bd-ec3ed9adef46"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 803, "text": "two major uprisings"}], "question": "what was the main issue with there being Russian rule with Poland", "id": "7cc9d8ee-75c2-416f-91f7-ce7dd4e9e1d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 464, "text": "Russian"}], "question": "Which army had the least soldiers, Russian or Japanese?", "id": "ba522776-2428-4a77-b794-2268c578d5ec"}]}]}, {"title": "history_459", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Dutch Reformed Church remained the largest church in the Netherlands until the middle of the 20th century, when the Roman Catholic Church passed it.

When Bears entered the game, there were 16 players in the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (the attack) was ruled out, Antrel Rolle (the ankle) was uncertain and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the attack had to be guarded against Bob Sutton's 3-4- defense, especially the front five, directed by line two Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, there were only nine sacks in the pitch jam in 2015. In order to combat defence, the Chiefs' corner defenders had to be targeted specifically at Jamell Fleming and beginner Marcus Peters, who were the biggest corner defenders of the NFL and four touchdowns. In addition, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL and the Red Zone, which were the worst in the league. The Chiefs also passed 11 goals and 295.5 goals per game (invested 28th in the league), but recorded only two kidnappings. In the last two games, the bear defense, which recorded six bags, faced a line of attack that allowed 19 hits. Despite OL\u2019s struggles, Chiefs\u2019 quarterback Alex Smith had a receiver, like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 reception yards in the previous game, even though Smith had 49.5 hits on the receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the assault, Chiefs had run Jamaal Charles, who was at least ten yards in the fastest race with Matt Forte, at the end of the 11th race. However, Charles had fallen 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. In special teams, former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub was led by Knile Davis (kicks) and De'Anthony Thomas (puppies). Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas ranked seventh in PR yards. The bear coverage unit received the Pro Bowl push-up Dustin Colquit, which was ranked fourth in the score average and third in the net average, but only released 51 yards of return, and Cairo Santos was leading the league in the field paintings. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, watch over Patrick Omeh and defenseman Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the throws and postponed the second half.

Three games to go through, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey fired Jay Cutler at the finish line, leading Ramik Wilson to find the dolly that gave Chiefs a goal pass. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points at the end of the first quarter with Robbie Gould\u2019s 44-yard goal. The Chiefs finally hit again, and the Bears were again caught in their own five-yard line. Drive stopped, and Pat O'Donnell weighed from the finish line. Despite the battles of the team\u2019s attack head, the Bears failed to miss the Chiefs during the next run, and after the third round, Smith threw the pass to Thomas, who scored a goal at the 19-yard match. Kansas City raised the margin to 17-3 while the second quarter remained nine seconds on Santos 35-yard goal. Cutler knelt to the end of the first half. In the first round of the second half Chiefs, the attack reached the nine-yard line of the Bears, but Pernell McPhee rejected Santos' goal in the field, which allowed the Bears to get a seat on their own 17. The first game of bear departure was the ten-yard run of Forte during the first run-down, which marked the first opening quarter of the Bears, and the series ended with Gould's 30-yard goal. The next four rounds of the game ended in weights, while one of the series held by the Bears ended up in turnover downhill. When there was a 7.51 game left, Cutler tried to lead another consecutive game. The first drive lasted 11 games and 88 yards, and it ended with Cutler throwing a 22-yard goal pitch to Marquess Wilson at the corner of the left end. The bears tried to win two, but Cutler's permission to Marian was ruled out, and after the challenge, the decision was passed. The Chiefs finally hit again when the Bears started their next departure with their own 33. Cutler led the attack on eight of the 67-yard rounds, which ended with a seven-yard touchdown feed despite clicking on Forte. However, the bears failed to convert two points. The Chiefs started their last time run on their own 33 when there were 11 seconds left in the game. Smith got to Maclin with a pass on the 48th of the Bears, and in the next game, he threw Maclin a nine-yard pass. But Maclin juggled the pass when he crossed his line. As a result, the two seconds remaining Chiefs decided to try the NFL record on 66 yards of field paint. However, Santos\u2019 kick was short, when the Bears won 18-17. This was Chicago's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993, where the Bears won 19-17. Two team records were made during the game. After his second field goal in the game, Gould became the leading scorer in franchise history by 1 168 points, which bypassed Kevin Butler. The victory was with Cutler's 46th Bears, which bound Jim McMahon's team's history the most.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2517, "text": "Ramik Wilson"}, {"answer_start": 120, "text": "Chiefs"}], "question": "Who scored the first touchdown of the game?", "id": "eb9cd224-4836-45fc-8adc-15b4a66cdef3"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1963, "text": "Santos"}, {"answer_start": 1963, "text": "Santos"}], "question": "Which player attempted a 66 yard field goal?", "id": "6915656c-d98e-4938-9e00-bdc4e967f034"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 131, "text": "31-3"}, {"answer_start": 2341, "text": "18"}], "question": "What was the winning score?", "id": "dcbe63b8-be1d-465f-9efb-1bf7bbe9a59e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 134, "text": "3"}, {"answer_start": 3105, "text": "17"}], "question": "What was the losing total?", "id": "1ce4463e-39a1-4b8d-b6ca-643331827605"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 400, "text": "4"}, {"answer_start": 400, "text": "4"}], "question": "How many field goals were made in this game?", "id": "29708a89-5223-4edd-be24-1128b7b7695b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3167, "text": "35"}, {"answer_start": 3167, "text": "35"}], "question": "How many points in total were scored?", "id": "fbc24a20-7568-47ec-9618-5fc9dd052f23"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 5029, "text": "1"}, {"answer_start": 5029, "text": "1"}], "question": "How many points did the Bears win by?", "id": "636c2763-ba02-4db0-b2dd-a4abda571337"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 142, "text": "Bears"}, {"answer_start": 142, "text": "Bears"}], "question": "Who scored more points, Bears or chiefs?", "id": "fca7116f-43b4-4fb3-95b9-350f39057dfa"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 120, "text": "Chiefs"}, {"answer_start": 2517, "text": "Ramik Wilson"}], "question": "Who scored the first points of the game?", "id": "d52ba158-62a8-4e73-b04d-f0c69426ecf6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 142, "text": "Bears"}, {"answer_start": 142, "text": "Bears"}, {"answer_start": 142, "text": "Bears"}], "question": "Who scored the first points of the second half?", "id": "2e8baded-df2d-4548-aced-7e80e08013ce"}]}]}, {"title": "nfl_350", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Chicago Bears wearing bright orange uniforms and showing their speed on defense and special teams, and it surprised the 49-year-olds from Bye Week.

The meeting of the Braunau Parliament took place in December 1705 in Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and German parliamentaryism, the meeting took place on 21 December 1705 at the inn, which belonged to Baron von Paumgarten. The representatives of the four Bavarian manors, aristocracy, priests, burgers and peasants met. The Braunau Parliament is the name of the Bavarian State Congress on Defence in Braunau. Ms Inn met on 21 December 1705. After the first uprising in November 1705, the Austrians reacted little to nearly two months. However, the situation changed when the rebels tried to hijack the capital of Bavaria, Munich. After their failed attack on December 25, 1705, an Austrian column met with a peasant army near Senderling outside Munich. The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder or Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The rebels in Oberland, Bavaria, were defeated, and the troops of Emperor Joseph I took them out completely. It is estimated that some 1 100 men died on the Bavarian side in this battle, but the Austrians lost only about 40 people. Some of the rebels died after they had already surrendered. About two weeks later, on January 8, 1706, Aidenbach\u2019s battle ended with the total defeat of the rebels and some 4,000 deaths on the Bavarian side.

Reynaldo Hill rejected the goal feed of the Kevan Barlow 1-yard. After another Titans kick, Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher became impatient when he started quarterback Kerry Collins, drawing him to the side of new quarterback Vince Young. Young drove the Titans to the 32-yard line of the Jets, but subexecuted David Givens in the next game, and Andre Dyson stopped him. Pennington drove the Jets into the red zone of Titans, finishing a ten-yard pass for Sean Ryan, but Keith Bulluck hit Ryan hard and broke when Tennessee recovered. Two games later, however, Jets got the ball back when back to the game entered Collins stopped Dyson, who was the second quarter. Setting up a store on the 36-yard of the Titans benefited Jets when Pennington threw an eight-yard goal pitch to Jerricho Cotchery, while the first half had 18 seconds left, but Kicker Mike Nugent struck a point-off attempt to leave the Jets at 13-0. Tennesse\u2019s grief in the passover continued as the second half began, when Collins again stopped Kerry Rhodes, who returned the ball to Tennessee 22 to 25 yards away. Nugent fired the 18-yard goal when the drive stopped on the one-yard line. The next time the Jets were held, Pennington drove back into the red zone, but Nugent missed the 34-yard field goal on the right. In the next possession of the Jets, Pennington seemed to have found Cotchery's two-yard touchdown feed, but the touchdown was nullified by D'Brickashaw Ferguson. When the drive stopped, Nugent missed another field goal and hit the right vertical from 30 meters away. Tennessee finally got the benefit of Travis Henry's three-yard run when there was 10.48 left. Tennessee took two and brought Young. Young's passport to Bobby Wade was incomplete, but Jets' defensive-backed Derrick Salmi got hit, which gave Titans another life. They'd use Collins to turn Henry over for conversion. After the weight shop, Jets took his 11th, when there was 7:28 left. In the third round, Cortland Finnegan fired Pennington, and Tennessee Randy Starks recovered on the 1-yard line in New York. Tennessee took two and turned, Collins found Drew Bennett open, and the game was exactly 16-16. Jets came right back, first as Justin Miller returned to 41 yards and then as Pennington was running steadily downhill when he found a 7- and 57-metre drive from Baker's 12-yard goal feed to the cap. The Jets had to hold on, because on the next hand Collins found Bennett at 26 yards moving the ball to the center field, and then he finished the long passes to Ben Troupe and Wade to move the ball to the Jets 12-yard line where the game was played 1:11.

This was the first match at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21 and the first one since 2011 when Raiders won in Oakland 25-20. Bears' attack was led by Khalil Mack, while the second was directed by 39-year-old Charles Woodson, who had 61 career listenings, and he had sealed the Raiders victory against the Browns the previous week. Raiders, however, had fought hard heads and had allowed five catches of at least 25 meters, a total of 20 catches of 298 yards and five goals in the first three games. Chicago was in defense of quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders attack to 74 points in the last two games, as well as the rookie attacker Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions in the game, while recording 68 yards of touchdown on week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to stop Raiders from getting the yard after the ball was touched. Raiders was on the seventh leg after the catch, while Latavius Murray, who had recorded 139 raids in week three, ranked fourth in the league in the assault yards, and he led AFC on foot per canton, 4.8 - ranked fifth on foot after contact. After the catch, Cooper had 177 yards, which is the second largest number in the wide receiver series, while 53.7 per cent of Carr\u2019s passing yards took place due to these games. By comparison, the Bears allow the least distance after contact. David Fales, the pusher Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grassu, tackled Jermon Bushrod, and Nasnataklaus Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Raiders won a coin toss and postponed the second half. The bears managed to record an 80-yard drive through the opening section with Jay Cutler's seven-yard goal feed to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed in the middle of Will Montgomery's leg, wounded the latter and replaced Matt Slauson. Robbie Gould\u2019s extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the next kick as his sparkle kick bounced out. After the next four games, Raiders scored a goal with Carr's 26-yard goal pass to Cooper. Although Raiders were originally excluded, he challenged the call and the decision was reversed. In the next series of bears, Slauson screwed up with Cutler, and Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland benefited from the pick-up point when Roy Helu scored at the four-yard touchdown reception, although Bears responded to Cutler using open Martellus Bennett in the five-yard touchdown. In the next round of Oakland, Carr hit a pass for Murray, and Pernell McPhee, and hit the bait, and Gould finally kicked the 19-yard goal. In the second half, the Raiders hit the first round, even though they got the ball back after Stacy McGee found Matt Forte. Oakland finally took over with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard goal. Gould finally gave Bears a lead at the 54-yard kick of Gould, and took over the ball as Murray dropped the pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the bears gave the ball back when Cutler\u2019s pass to Bennett was short and Woodson hijacked it, which led to Janikowski\u2019s 41-yard goal. When there was 2.05 left, Cutler started a two-minute exercise: after Forte's six-yard run, beaten by Mack and fourth by Josh Bellamy's unfinished pitch, Cutler managed to turn the seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keena Lambert. Cutler\u2019s next pass to Marquess Wilson was short, and Forte\u2019s seven-yard run led to another third downhill, leading to Cutler\u2019s seven-yard conversion to Wilson at 56 seconds. On the next count, Cutler's pass to Cameron Meredith was knocked down, even though the 12-yard breakup with Royal allowed the crime to enter the Oakland area, where the Bears chose a 40-second time-out. The injury reached the field goal area at Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, after which Forte ran two yards. With seven seconds left, Bears used another timeout and allowed Gould to try 49 yards of field paint. Gould turned the field goal successfully when two seconds were left to get the Bears 22-20 wire. Last-minute goalmaking attempt Raiders tried to skip the kick-off, but he was punished for an illegal by-game early in the game, and eventually the Bears recovered to victory. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, who is his third ST POTW award and tied him up with Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger\u2019s kickers most in the team\u2019s history. Field goal was the eleventh in Gould's career. Forte ran 91 yards in the game to raise the total number of running yards of his career to 8 071, who became the 14th player in NFL history, who recorded the 8000 and 3,500 career rushes and received a reception and at the same time became the second fastest player to reach the milestone in 111 games.

The end date is either 1920 or 1921; this confusion is due to the fact that while the ceasefire entered into force in the autumn of 1920, the official agreement to end the war was signed months later, in March 1921.

Next, in the possession of Broncos, Colts' sponsor, Robert Mathis, forced Manning to roar out of the target area, which led to security. After that, Colts took the lead again when Luck connected 20 yards to Stanley Havil and then added eight yards to his lead with a goal pitch from Lucca to Coby Fleener just before half time. The Bronco attack went three times out of its first three assets in the third quarter, and the Colts moved to 33-14 as Tuuri rushed into the ten-yard finish line. At the end of the third quarter, Broncos tried to narrow the Colts' lead when the goal was scored by the 31-yard runner Matt Prater, but Colts responded at the beginning of the fourth quarter with Vinatier 52-yard goal. The Broncos followed the 36-17-speed rally as Manning combined the 31-yard goal feed with the wide receiver Demary Thomas (who failed in a two-point conversion attempt) and then the 1-yard finish pass with the Knowshon Moreno run.

Before that, the NFL analysts considered this competition to be a top-notch competition for the coming decade and a top-notch competition for the decade. Both teams proved it when Seattle competed at the off-season when Percy Harvin and San Francisco captured Anqua Boldin, among other things, at the off-season. Last season the teams were 1-1 against each other, Seattle was a better team when they blew up Niners 42-13 at the last meeting in Seattle, by the way, also Sunday night football. It was also the day Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick seemed to be betting on the eyebrows where the loser shaved his eyebrows, which later became a commercial trick. Finally, it was the day that the former Seahawk Shaun Alexander lifted the 12th man flag. But the game began quietly, as both sides failed to create a rhythm. The game was delayed in the middle of the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, another similar event in the season 2013 (the Ravens-Broncos kickoff at week 1 was the first). When they got back to the field, 49-year-olds blocked the Seahawks' weight and got the ball into the Seattle area. Seattle, however, claimed that the mob heard a whistle that confused the linemen and the pushers. The NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth later explained this claim. The Niners took advantage and drove Seattle to the 10-yard line. Third, however, Earl Thomas hijacked Colin Kaepernick's pass, and Seattle got control. A few plays later, beginner Eric Reid kidnapped Russell Wilson, and the tow of the war continued for the second quarter. Everything was quiet until the middle of the second quarter, when Bruce Miller was caught in a situation that led to a safe situation and Seattle 2-0. Later, Defense Head Cliff Avril fired Kaepernick and K.J. Wright recovered to Seattle, resulting in Steven Hauschka\u2019s 30-yard goal. In halftime, a small 5-0 lead from the Seahawks. At that point the game was pretty dark and messy, the only bright side was Seattle, which led Marshawn Lynch. In the third quarter Seahawks came out screaming. The third and 12 Wilson had a connection to Doug Baldwin's 51-yard win within the 49ers 25-yard line. A few plays later Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12-0 in Seattle. 49ers responded in a round to Seattle\u2019s 6-yard line, which was limited by Phil Dawson\u2019s 21-yard field goal, which included Kaepernick\u2019s 28-yard rush with 12-3 Seahawks. However, it would be for the Niners and the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Seahawks dismantled Niners at all stages of the game. It started when Wilson hit Lynch with a 7-yard goal in the third round. Richard Sherman stopped Kaepernick, who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That led to the 37-yard Steven Hauschka's field goal. During the Niners race, Kaepernick was stopped again, this time by the Safety Kam Chancellor, who had concluded an extension agreement earlier in the year. Lynch made a two-yard run in the next game. Seattle led 29-3. The 49ers broke the next kick, and Seattle recovered. Seattle won all the critics with a convincing style. The 12th man also broke the Guinness world record for the loudest outdoor stadium.

The following year they surrounded Pskov, but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their ground until 27 February 1617, when the Stolbovo agreement deprived Russia of access to the Baltic Sea and granted Sweden access to the district of Ingria with Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Gothenburg. Novgorod and Gdov had to be returned to Russia. As a result of the war, Russia was denied access to the Baltic Sea for some 100 years, despite persistent efforts to reverse the situation.

It also meant the second consecutive year when Raiders began the season on the road. On September 9, before the first game of the season, Raiders put Sebastian Janikowski on reserve because of an injured back. Giorgio Tavecchio got fired from the training team. Raiders started well when the Titans tried to surprise Raiders with the opening kick that Raiders recovered. Four fights later, Derek Carr hit Amari Cooper, who pitched eight yards of paint to give Raiders a 7-0 lead. The Titans responded to their next race and continued 75 yards in 12 games with Marcus Mario rushing into the ten-yard touchdown goal for a draw. Raiders came back when Tavecchio hit the first field goal of his career, the 20-yard, to give Raiders a 10-7 lead. After changing weights at the beginning of the second quarter, the Titans tied up the game with 43 seconds left in half time with Ryan Succop 23-yard goal. The Raider attack moved 41 yards away, when Tavecchio\u2019s second field goal, 52 yards away, moved to Raiders\u2019 half-time lead 13-10. During the second half, the Raider defense kept the Titans in check in successive rounds, when Raiders finished the second 52-yard field goal with which the lead was extended to 16-10, while the third round was left for just over four minutes. Raider defense prevented Titans from going to touchdown by forcing Titans to settle for the 26-yard goal, which narrowed the gap to 16-13 after the end of the season. In the fourth quarter, Carr ran the Raiders series in seven rounds, 70 yards, with Seth Roberts\u2019 19-yard touchdown reception. The Raiders defense, which fought tremendously in the previous year, forced the Titans to strike, and after that they reached the field goal of 4:49 left. Another Tavecchio field goal, this time at 43 yards, reached 26-16 when the game was left at 1:14. The Titans couldn't put together more when the 52-yard field goal remained for 12 seconds when Raiders scored 26-16. In victory, Tavecchio became the first kicker in NFL history to make two 50-yard field goals in the NFL debut. After his performance Tavecchio was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week.

The Vikings then completed a significant return when Favre found a wide receiver at Sidney Rice\u2019s 6 yard TD feed on the 4th and 2nd goals, with 15 seconds left to play. Then the Bears knelt to force them by force. On overtime, the Bears won the pitch and marched to the airport, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, Gould\u2019s potential 45-yard goal was missed, which enabled the Vikings to win. After the change of weights, Vikings had a ball on the 26-yard line, with 11 minutes left to play. In the first game, Favre pitched Peterson, who caught it and walked 16 meters before he met Hunter Hillenmeyer, who made Peterson shake the ball, and then Bears defenseman Nick Roach got back. Then the Bears won the Jay Cutler 39-yard TD pitch at Devin Aromashodu. With the loss, the Vikings fell 11-4 and gave the home field advantage also to the Saints.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1096, "text": "6"}, {"answer_start": 1096, "text": "6"},

The former currency was put into a floating system when investors sold their jewelry faster than the government could buy them. This followed the global trend to abandon developing countries that year. Investors were also concerned that the economic change in the Republic was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which was close to 8% of GDP. In the wake of the crisis, two savings packages were introduced later in the spring, reducing government expenditure by 2.5% of GDP. The growth fell to 0.3% in 1997, -2.3% in 1998 and -0.5% in 1999.

After Matthew Slater returned the Carpenter job on the 29-yard line, Patriots began his first ownership on his 40-yard line. Cassel\u2019s first two assists were both completed for the first landings when patriots were placed in the dolphins \u2019 territory and eventually in their red territory. However, Neal\u2019s punishment pushed Patriots back ten yards away and forced the 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four games later, which led him to 3-0. After three rounds of Dolphins, the second trip to Patriots ended when both Moss and corner defenseman Jason Allen cleaned Cassel out of the pitch to Moss to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill caught it. The 17-yard return gave Dolphins a ball on the 42-yard line of the patriots. In the next play, David Martin\u2019s reception at 29 yards moved dolphins to the red zone of Patriots, where dolphins used their \u201cWildcat\u201d composition in the next two plays. On the second run of Ronnie Brown, Tedy Bruschi scored the first goal where Camarillo got a 3 yard pass from Pennington in front of the goal, which took Dolphins to 7-3. Patriots responded in the 74-yard round of 12 games, which ended in the first game of the second quarter. Cassel scored an 8-yard goal pitch to get Patriots back the lead, 10-7. The next drive by Dolphins was three and a half, although two more games were played in the Wildcat formation, which gave the patriots a ball on their own 41-yard line. One-yard Morris ran off the 28-yard Dolphins line and Matt Roth tackled during the tackle, and the ball was recovered by Dolphins\u2019 cornerman Andr&#233; Goodman Dolphins 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of turnover, went 72 yards in 12 games and took the lead in a 14-10-speed 7-yard Pennington touchdown compact. Slater returned Carpenter's follow-up kick from the Patriots 24-yard line. Slater started his next departure from his 37-yard line. Six games later, Cassel finished a 25-yard goal pitch for Moss, who gave Patriots another lead, 17-14. After three rounds, the dolphins began their last half, with 39 seconds left and moved to the Patriots area. After the Vrabel kick, the wrong start of the Pennington winger Ted Ginn Jr. ended in the first half. Because of delaying the opening kick, dolphins chose the second half kick. The first 46-yard Pennington pitched the dolphins into the 36-yard line of the patriots. Six games later Pennington hit the jackpot with Casey Cramer's 2-yard narrowing shot, which gave Dolphins back the lead in 21-17. Patriots responded by going 78 yards in 11 games, once again taking the lead in Moss's second touchdown. The 8-yard grip took Patriots ahead 24-21. Dolphins' next ride reached the 27-yard line of the Patriots, but the attack penalty, the incomplete pass and the firing forced Dolphins to defeat the 42-yard line of the patriots. Two games later Cassel finished the pass to the middle Welker. The wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards. After the unfinished pass to Moss, the 21-yard Faulk-touchdown led the Patriots to 31-21 in the last game of the third quarter. Four games for the dolphins in the 3rd and 3rd rounds, Pennington hit the 36-yard victory of Davone Bess to get the dolphins into the Patriots' red zone. In the next game, a dive at the 13-yard goal of Ricky Williams took Patriots to the top of 31-28. During his next ride, Patriots moved to Dolphins area with 23 yards of Gaffney. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss contacted their third touchdown feed of the day, 29 meters away to get a 38-28 lead for the Patriots. In the next play, Meriweather grabbed the Pennington Pass and returned it 19 meters to the 18-yard dolphin line. However, security Yeremiah Bell fired Cassel in the 3rd and 2nd installment to create a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots' lead to 41-28 when there was more than seven minutes left to play. The dolphins started their own 1-yard after the Ginn kick came back from defeat and arrest. The dolphins moved the ball to the 44-yard line in ten games, but failed to turn fourth and turn the ball back to Patriots. Patriots, only four minutes left to play, ran exclusively after running the Green-Ellis game in their possession, moved to the dolphins' red zone in a row because of Porter's excessive roughness and unsporting behavioral punishments. In the fourth round of six games, Green-Ellis ran one yard touchdown to give Patriots a 48-28 lead goal. Dolphins ran by 20 points in the remaining 37 seconds of one game to finish the game and improve the Patriots record to 7-4. The 530 net yards of the Patriots were the second highest score in team history behind the 597 yards of the Patriots in 1979. Cassel\u2019s 415 pass-by made him a second quarterback in Patriots history who threw at least 400 meters in two or more games. Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yards in his Patriots career.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 4565, "text": "20"}], "question": "How many points did New England win by?", "id": "0db6d7f7-de1a-4c22-9835-8b51ab2b1781"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 502, "text": "Gostkowski"}, {"answer_start": 502, "text": "Gostkowski"}], "question": "Which player scored the first field goal of the game?", "id": "e29cce01-6fec-49c0-9e53-40b1e6f0c8b1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 559, "text": "3"}], "question": "How many points was New England winning by at halftime?", "id": "a16fc6ad-fb3d-4b4e-8da0-d87e49b6c17a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3156, "text": "31"}], "question": "How many total points were scored by halftime?", "id": "4fd62ccc-d05d-40c8-852f-bd2a07697272"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 4565, "text": "20"}, {"answer_start": 4565, "text": "20"}], "question": "How many points did the Patriots win the game by?", "id": "c1ff557f-25a8-470e-b6fe-a121cf94769d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 559, "text": "3"}, {"answer_start": 559, "text": "3"}], "question": "How many points were the Patriots leading by at the end of the first half?", "id": "e55d1e36-25b9-4f29-981d-2a22f576a000"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2030, "text": "25-yard"}, {"answer_start": 1317, "text": "8-yard"}, {"answer_start": 183, "text": "29-yard"}, {"answer_start": 2030, "text": "25-yard"}, {"answer_start": 1317, "text": "8-yard"}, {"answer_start": 900, "text": "29 yards"}], "question": "How long were each of Randy Moss's touchdown receptions?", "id": "dc62e06c-7f3d-4957-93da-85d09525c7b9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1826, "text": "7-yard"}, {"answer_start": 1317, "text": "8-yard"}, {"answer_start": 1317, "text": "8-yard"}, {"answer_start": 1826, "text": "7-yard"}], "question": "How long were the two touchdown scrambles?", "id": "6639ffe0-acdd-40cc-a6f5-081c6e09df04"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3120, "text": "Faulk"}, {"answer_start": 3120, "text": "Faulk"}], "question": "Who scored on the longest touchdown run?", "id": "cca8a213-10a9-4452-81ff-4a9394d8a719"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1911, "text": "the Patriots"}, {"answer_start": 56, "text": "Patriots"}], "question": "Which team got the ball first?", "id": "2ed0b78d-5bb5-4a6d-a471-c1c97c3eaa2e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1911, "text": "the Patriots"}, {"answer_start": 56, "text": "Patriots"}], "question": "Which team scored first?", "id": "bd137d44-3d55-4b3f-bed6-949d6ce6a3ed"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3156, "text": "31"}, {"answer_start": 3156, "text": "31"}], "question": "How many points were scored in the first half?", "id": "d2da01ff-78d7-46ab-9b88-f1b15df9c477"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 502, "text": "Gostkowski"}, {"answer_start": 502, "text": "Gostkowski"}], "question": "Who scored the first points of the game?", "id": "1ada0532-f95d-4376-a43d-da92aa6bbb4a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 4565, "text": "20"}, {"answer_start": 4565, "text": "20"}], "question": "How many points did the Dolphins lose by?", "id": "7361d127-759d-484a-99e9-0eea91ce5cae"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2536, "text": "2"}, {"answer_start": 2536, "text": "2"}], "question": "How many 30 yard field goals did Gostkowski kick?", "id": "de72742b-8465-4dda-aebc-8aa9d86a17ea"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 109, "text": "4"}, {"answer_start": 109, "text": "4"}], "question": "How many points ahead were the Dolphins after Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer?", "id": "b5812c99-494b-4730-a7b2-cca7bff83c91"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 640, "text": "Moss"}, {"answer_start": 253, "text": "Cassel"}], "question": "Who scored a touchdown from the farthest distance?", "id": "500eb537-6c16-447b-ae0d-f480eb336156"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 559, "text": "3"}, {"answer_start": 109, "text": "4"}], "question": "How many holding penalties were there?", "id": "427e1df0-6235-4997-bcb5-6df781e6956d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 109, "text": "4"}, {"answer_start": 109, "text": "4"}], "question": "How many points behind did Camarillo's 3-yard pass from Pennington put the Patriots?", "id": "b35ab00e-fe1c-4227-9f89-3267fad6ae6c"}]}]}, {"title": "history_2766", "paragraphs": [{"context": "According to Census in the United Kingdom, in 2011, 45.7% of the population were white (34.5% Caucasian, 1.1% Irish, 0.2% British).

Domestic pigs had several centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and South-West Asia, where wild boars were tamed for the first time about 10 500 years ago. In the South American Andes, potatoes were tamed from 10,000 to 7,000 years ago with beans, coke, llamas, alpacas and guinea pigs.

Cotton was discharged in Peru 5,600 years ago, and it was discharged independently in Eurasia. Mesoamerica's agriculture, wild work, was tamed into corn 6,000 years ago. Researchers have developed several hypotheses to explain the historical origin of agriculture.

The longer Barkers were Kathleen Bradley (1990-2000), Holly Hallstrom (1977-1995), Dian Parkinson (1975-1993) and Janice Pennington (1972-2000). Pennington and Bradley were dismissed from the program in 2000 and it was claimed that they had witnessed on behalf of Hallstroms in the false termination proceedings against Barker and the show. Following the departure of Nikki Ziering, Heather Kozar and Claudia Jordan in the 21st century, producers decided to use a rotating collection (up to ten) until the middle of season 37, after which the series returned to five standard models. Since March 2008, the models have been Rachel Reynolds, Amber Lancaster and Gwendolyn Osbourne (who left in 2017), Manuela Arbel\u00e1ez joined the actors in April 2009 in place of Brandi Sherwood and James OHalloran in December 2014. Carey does not use the common name of the models, but refers to them by name, hoping that the models could use the exhibition as a stepping stone to promote their career. Unlike previous practice, the models shown in a specific section are named separately in the screen credits and are officially referred to as \"The Price Is Right\" when they are grouped in events. From the age of 37, the exhibition often uses a guest model for certain awards, often for another CBS property or for a company offering the prize. Some models have been male, in particular for musical instruments, tools, trucks and motorcycles, and have been used for visiting appearances during Showcase. Due to the traditional female population of day-to-day TV programmes and the pregnancies of Reynolds and Osbourne, CBS announced that a one-week male model would be added to the series during season 41, which is compatible with the franchising programme that used the random male model with other countries. The show looked for a man on the Internet in an online competition involving Michael G. Richards, Production Manager Reynolds, Lancaster, Osbourne and Arbel\u00e1ez, who served as judges and mentors during the network series. The winners were chosen by the audience in October 2012. On 5 October 2012, CBS announced that the winner of the male model online competition was Robert Scott Wilson from Boston, Massachusetts. Wilson presented as a model in the episodes through April 15, 2014. The competition was due to be repeated in 2014, when the auditions took place during the break of the FIFA World Cup in May-July 2014.
